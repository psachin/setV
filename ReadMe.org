  /Lightweight Python virtual environment manager/

  For more than a year *setV* was lying under [[https://github.com/psachin/bash_scripts][bash_scripts]]. I use it
  as an alternative to [[https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/][virtualenvwrapper]]. It is a Bash function which
  provides basic features such as:
  - Create new virtual environment
  - Delete existing virtual environment(s)
  - List existing virtual environment(s)
  - In case you don't remember virtual environment name, TAB completion
    works :)

** Installation
   Run the command
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psachin/setV/master/install.sh | sh -
   #+END_SRC

** Usage
   - First of all, the command is =setv=
   - When you install =setv=, the installation script will ask you to
     source =~/.bashrc= or =~/.bash_profile=. Please do that.

** Screencast(Installation & Usage)
   [[./img/screencast.gif]]

*** Create virtual environment
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      setv --new rango
    #+END_SRC

*** Activate existing environment

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      setv VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_NAME
    #+END_SRC

    For example
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      setv rango
    #+END_SRC

*** List all virtual environment(s)
    You can list existing virtual environments by typing
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      setv --list
      # or
      setv [TAB] [TAB]
    #+END_SRC

*** Delete virtual environment
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      setv --delete rango
    #+END_SRC

*** Switch to another virtual environment
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh options
      # Assuming you are in 'rango', switch to 'tango' using
      setv tango
    #+END_SRC

*** In case you don't fully remember virtual environment name
     - Bash-like TAB completion works for virtual environment names
